# Countries Detail

I developed it using React Native on the front and two separate Web APIs on the back, which present the country information and display the country flags. Countries are listed in order, they can also be filtered by name or code. By opening the content of the desired country, the phone code, domain extension, capital, currency, country population, area, languages used in the country, neighboring countries, etc. information about that country is shown in detail.

## To start the project

npm install

react-native run-android || react-native run-ios
